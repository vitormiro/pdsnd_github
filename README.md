### Description
This is the second Programming project for the Data Science Nanodegree Program

The aim of the project is "to make use of Python to explore data related to bicycle sharing systems in three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York and Washington". The data needed to be read from the csv files and processed using the Python, Pandas and NumPy libraries. The user must be guided by the program and be able to obtain some computed statistics, such as popular travel times, popular stations or information from users of the sharing system such as age and gender.
